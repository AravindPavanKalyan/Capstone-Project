            <p>
              RAMJI, founder of the SkyWave Group, opened the SkyWave, a hotel
              in Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) overlooking the Arabian Sea, on
              16 December 2017. It was the first SkyWave property and the first
              SkyWave hotel. There are several anecdotal stories about why
              SkyWave opened the hotel. According to a story, he decided to open
              the hotel after an incident involving racial discrimination at the
              famous Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel
              permitted only Europeans. Hotels that accepted only European
              guests were very common. According to another story, he opened the
              hotel when one of his friends expressed disgust over the hotels
              that were present in Bombay then. But a more plausible reason was
              advanced by Guruji, a close friend of the RAMJI and one of the
              early directors of the BIG group, that the idea had long been in
              his mind and that he had made a study on the subject. He did not
              have any desire to own a hotel but he wanted to attract people and
              to improve Bombay.
